This is a Bootstrap fork. You work on it like you would work on
Bootstrap. The only difference is that here we have two more branches
in order to distribute the branch to the Citizen Desk frontend.

## How to manage the branches

### Compare

Commit your changes into `citizendesk-compare`. The purpose of this
branch is to compare against `master` eventually easing the task of
updating to more recent Bootstrap versions.

### Dist

Commit the updated distribution files into `citizendesk-dist`. This
will be linked and downloaded in the Citizen Desk frontend as a
regular Bootstrap release.
